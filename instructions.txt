These are the instructions to make a website for our Telescope Simulator app, which will be on the Play Store.

This document will serve as a guide and reference to everything about the construction of the webpage.


1. This website will be hosted on Github Pages.
2. This website should have a modern feel with slight animations, not just plain HTML. 
3. IT is up to the AI to decide which frameworks and tools to use.

The main reference picture is @TelescopeSimulatorWebsiteMockup.png

The website shall consist of two pages. First, the main page, which should lookk like the mockup above.
    - Also, instead of the header background being just blue like in the mockup, we want the WebsiteBackground.jpg picture to be the background instead.

The second page is a simple privacy policy page, which Google Play needs for its services. 

On the mockup screenshot, the middle right shows a screenshot carousel for pictures of the app. The images for this carousel are found in the Screenshots folder.
